The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript - Library

In this project, I'll be using the knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS course, and incorporate Javascript objects and arrays in order to save 
Book data for a digital Library. The books will have title, author and page info, along with a read/not read toggle button. You'll be able to 
add new books with HTML forms.
My goal for this project is to start implementing Object Oriented Programming (which I've studied more deeply in Java) into my Javascript code.
